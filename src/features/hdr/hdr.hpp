// The scene in float, and HDR10 output (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, "HDR"). Fox Engine tonemaps early, in the
// deferred resolve and in the sky, clouds and ocean, and everything after worked on that tonemapped image
// in 8 bits: glass and particles, the reflections, bloom, the depth of field, the grading, FXAA and the
// HUD. On a supported build the scene keeps its light until the grading, in SDR too, where the 8 bits
// showed as bands in smooth fog:
//
// - With HDR output, the swap chain becomes R10G10B10A2 with flip model, in the HDR10 colour space (PQ,
//   BT.2020).
// - The scene target and its copy, which the renderer makes at known places, become 16-bit float.
//   They hold sRGB-encoded colour, which 8-bit formats encode and decode in their _SRGB views; the
//   float targets keep the encoded values, so a draw through such a view (the resolve) is encoded
//   after it, and reads through one (the reflections, from the copy) get a decoded twin.
// - The game's shaders with TppTonemap get it taken out as they are made, and the sky's clamp to 1.
// - What expects the tonemapped image gets it: bloom's quarter-size copy is tonemapped as it is made,
//   and the depth of field composites over a float copy of the scene.
// - The grading pass tonemaps for the game's grading; with HDR output it then adds back the light the
//   tonemap took.
// - GammaControl, which wrote the back buffer, applies the game's brightness and maps the light to
//   the display: with HDR output, its range; in SDR, 8 bits with a dither of half a step, which hides
//   the steps left.
// - The 2D pass's writes are clamped to 0 to 1, as the 8-bit target clamped them.
//
// DLSS runs in its HDR mode on the light (upscaler.cpp).
