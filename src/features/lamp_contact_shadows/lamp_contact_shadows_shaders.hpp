// renodx-mgsv's screen-space term, which costs a handful of depth reads per pixel the light's volume
// covers, where Bend Studio's trace cost a compute dispatch over that volume's whole screen
// rectangle with 120 samples a pixel. The ray starts at the surface the pixel shows, steps a fraction
// of the contact shadow's reach towards the light, and counts the steps the depth buffer puts a
// surface in front of. A caster only counts within a separation that grows with the distance, so
// layered gear on a character is not read as a wall in front of its own surface. A pixel whose surface
// faces away from the light is skipped: the light adds nothing there, so its shadow is never read.
