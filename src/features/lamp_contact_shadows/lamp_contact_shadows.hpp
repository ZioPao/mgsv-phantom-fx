// The lamps' contact shadows (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, "Screen-space shadows"), drawn by the local light
// pass (local_light_pass.hpp). A point or spot light draws its volume twice, to mark the stencil and
// then to light. At the first, the add-on traces Bend Studio's screen-space shadow towards the light
// within its reach (contact_shadow_trace.hpp) and draws it into the light targets' unused alpha; the
// second's light is then scaled by it. One trace per light, so it costs far more where many lights
// are on screen.
