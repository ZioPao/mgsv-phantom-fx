// Volumetric fog with light shafts (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, "Volumetric fog"). Fox Engine computes its
// fog into a 512x256 texture at the start of each frame: 128 slices of view depth, each a 16x64 tile
// of view directions holding the fog from the camera to that depth, by an analytic formula that no
// shadow touches. The resolves, the sky, the clouds and every transparent draw read it.
//
// The add-on makes that texture larger, in the same layout, so all of them read finer fog unchanged.
// The game's fog pass fills all of it. With volumetric fog on, the add-on fills it again at the
// resolve, once the sun's shadow map is drawn: the game's formula slice by slice, with the sun's
// share shadowed, which gives light shafts. The physical look fills it with Earth's air and a
// height fog instead, and draws the sky from the same atmosphere in place of the game's sky.
